## Specification
The project aims to study ***cagA***, an _Helicobacter pylori_ virulence factor, as a risk factor of gastric cancer. </br>
We have focused our attention onto:
1. Analysis of _H. pylori_'s proteome;
2. Focus on _cagA_'s structure;
3. Interaction between _cagA_ and ***SHP2*** and its pro-oncogenic action.

## Results
We have listed here the files regarding the results of our analysis:
* _`CagA.cxs`_ file chimera file representing _cagA_ protein;
* _`Figure_1.png`_ file represents the relative abundances of the 703729 amino acids in _H. pylori_;
* _`UP000000429_85962.fasta`_ is a _FASTA_ file representing a reference proteome of H. pylori (strain ATCC 700392 / 26695);
* _`helicobacter_pylori.py`_ is a _.py_ file that:
  * Analyzes sequence frequency;
  * Defines the residues;
  * Gets the residues relative abundances.
* _`map05120.png`_ file shows a KEGG pathway representing interactions between genes as _cagPAI_ and _cagA_;
* _`sh2_EPIYA_D.cxs`_ chimera file representing _SHP2_ protein;
* _`tree_SHP2.pdf`_ file representing a phylogenetic tree based on the _SHP2_ protein order to see its evolutionary pattern across different animals.
